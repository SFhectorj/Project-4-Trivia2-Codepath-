# Project 4 - Trivia App

Submitted by: Hector Baeza

Random Trivia is an app that loads 5 trivia questions with the possibility of obtaining a question with 4 possible answers or a True/False question.
When choosing an answer the button will be highlighted green if the correct answer is chosen or red if incorrect.
The app tells you your score when you reach the end and wil give the user the option to restart the game.

## Notes

This was another difficult project. I spent a lot of time researching how to get the buttons to only display 2 buttons if a question is True/False.
I also had issues merging the answer with the possible choices and getting all 4 to display.
